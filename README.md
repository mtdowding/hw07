# HW7

At the beginning of the class a recurrence integral was developed however the program initially failed in calculating a small n correctly. This code is a solution to this recurrence integral as it will now output accurate results for all n. The program also compares performance as well as accuracy and time taken to output between reults for n from 1 and 100.
